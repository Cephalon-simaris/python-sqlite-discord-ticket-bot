# python-sqlite-discord-ticket-bot
A fully functioning discord ticket bot , made with python

Requirements - 

- pip install discord
- pip install aiosqlite

# Why is the bot setup not working?
Here is a possible list of reasons why :-

- the database.db file was not crearted
- the category ID is not mentioned properly
- the channel needs to be mentioned like #logs , don't type the channel ID
- the database is opened hence it's considered as locked when it's open , hence can't make changes in the file

If the reason specified is not above , feel free to contact me in my server!
